After inserting the CD in your CD-Rom Driver, the menu page will appear automatically 
on the screen. If it does not appear, then you may open it manually by clicking the CD icon on the 
"My Computer" windows

Make sure the program disc labled "Programming in C" is in your CD-ROM drive. From
the Program Manager, open the "File" menu and select "Run". In the "Command Line"
box, type "D:\start.html" and press Enter. If your CD-ROM drive is not drive "D", 
substitute the letter of your CD-ROM drive when you type this statement. For 
example, if your CD-ROM drive is drive "E", type "E:\start.html" and press Enter.

A page of selection will appear with a menu resided in the left pane labled as:
-> Chapter2
-> Chapter3
-> Chapter4,etc.

Select one of them to open the corresponding chapters. On each chapter, you will 
get some example questions and their corresponding source codes after clicking on: 
"Source Code (Toggle)". Then you can copy the code by right clicking on the code
and use it as your requirement: 

Either paste it on any text editor or directly paste it on any C Compiler editor
and save it with ".c" or ".cpp" extention before compiling.

Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the process.
